  This is an ALPS description of the semantics defined by the
  ActivityStreams standard. It is based on information published in
  the "JSON Activity Streams 1.0" standard
  [http://activitystrea.ms/specs/json/1.0/]

  The 'activity' in Activity Streams is a description of an action that
  was performed (the verb) at some instant in time by someone or
  something (the actor) against some kind of person, place, or thing
  (the object). There may also be a target (like a photo album or
  wishlist) involved.

  The 'stream' in Activity Streams is a feed of related activities for a
  given person or social object.

  Put together, Activity Streams is a convenient and consistent way to
  syndicate social activities around the web.

  This document does *not* describe real Activity Streams
  documents. Instead, it allows documents written in HTML,
  Collection+JSON, Siren, or other hypermedia type with ALPS support
  to use Activity Streams-style semantics. The goal of this document
  is to save the trouble of porting the semantics of Activity Streams
  to a plethora of representation formats.

    activity.
   </description>
  </child>

  <child id="target" href="#object" appears="MAY" cardinality="single">
   <description>
    Describes the target of the activity. The precise meaning of the
    activity's target is dependent on the activity's 'verb', but will
    often be the object of the English preposition "to". For instance,
    in the activity, "John saved a movie to his wishlist", the target
    of the activity is "wishlist". The activity target MUST NOT be
    used to identity an indirect object that is not a target of the
    activity.

     this document make good values for "verb". Note that the use of a
     relative reference other than a simple name is not allowed. If
     the verb is not specified, or if the value is null, the verb is
     assumed to be "post".

   announcement when John's wishlist changes ('provider'), and the
   service John uses to manage his wishlist ('genarator').

   Most social networking applications, for example, provide
   individual users with their own dedicated "profile" pages. Several
   allow similar types of pages to be created for commercial entities,
   organizations or events.

   While the specific details of how pages are implemented, their

<!--These are the verbs defined by the Activity Stream standard and
     the Activity Schema draft. They are defined here as relations
     indicating state transitions. This should be considered a grab
     bag of standardized names for state transitions commonly used in
     consumer-facing applications.

     All the state transitions are defined as "unsafe" even though
     this may not be true for a particular application. In one
     application, the "accept" transition may be idempotent; a user
     can only accept a given thing once. In a different context the
     "accept" transition may be unsafe: a user can accept the same
     thing many times.

     The only exception is "join", which the Activity Schema draft
     explicitly defines as idempotent. [TK we should either make our
     own value judgements or just make them all unsafe.]

     HTML example:

<form action="/g555" method="POST" class="acknowledge">
 <input type="Submit" value="Acknowledge receipt of this notice."/>
</form>

-->

 <element id="post" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   The act of authoring an object and then publishing it online.
  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="accept" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   The act of accepting an object. For instance, a person accepting an
   award, or accepting an assignment.
  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="access" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   The act of accessing the object. For instance, a person accessing a
   room, or accessing a file.
  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="acknowledge" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   Indicates that the actor has acknowledged the object. This
   effectively signals that the actor is aware of the object's
   existence.
  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="add" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   Indicates that the actor has added the object to the target. For
   instance, adding a photo to an album.
  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="agree" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   Indicates that the actor agrees with the object. For example, a
   person agreeing with an argument, or expressing agreement with a
   particular issue.

   Indicates that the actor has approved the object. For instance, a
   manager might approve a travel request.
  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="archive" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   Indicates that the actor has archived the object.
  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="assign" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   Indicates that the actor has assigned the object to the target.
  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="at" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   Indicates that the actor is currently located at the object. For
   instance, a person being at a specific physical location.
  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="attach" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   Indicates that the actor has attached the object to the target. For
   instance, a person attaching a file to a wiki page or an email.
  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="attend" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   Indicates that the actor has attended the object. For instance, a
   person attending a meeting.
  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="author" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   Indicates that the actor has authored the object. Note that this is
   a more specific form of the verb "create".
  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="authorize" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   Indicates that the actor has authorized the object. If a target is
   specified, it means that the authorization is specifically in
   regards to the target.

   For instance, a service can authorize a person to access a given
   application; in which case the actor is the service, the object is
   the person, and the target is the application.

   In contrast, a person can authorize a request; in which case the
   actor is the person and the object is the request and there might
   be no explicit target.
  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="borrow" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   Indicates that the actor has borrowed the object. If a target is
   specified, it identifies the entity from which the object was

   the target.
  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="build" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   Indicates that the actor has built the object. For example, if a
   person builds a model or compiles code.

   Indicates that the actor has checked-in to the object. For
   instance, a person checking-in to a Place.
  </description>
 </element>

   Indicates that the actor has closed the object. For instance, the
   object could represent a ticket being tracked in an issue
   management system.
  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="complete" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   Indicates that the actor has completed the object.
  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="confirm" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   Indicates that the actor has confirmed or agrees with the
   object. For instance, a software developer might confirm an issue
   reported against a product.
  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="consume" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   Indicates that the actor has consumed the object. The specific
   meaning is dependent largely on the object's type.  For instance,
   an actor may "consume" an audio object, indicating that the actor
   has listened to it; or an actor may "consume" a book, indicating
   that the book has been read.

   As such, the "consume" verb is a more generic form of other more
   specific verbs such as "read" and "play".
  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="create" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   Indicates that the actor has created the object.
  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="delete" type="unsafe">

   Indicates that the actor has delivered the object. For example,
   delivering a package.
  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="deny" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   Indicates that the actor has denied the object. For example, a
   manager may deny a travel request.
  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="disagree" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   Indicates that the actor disagrees with the object.
  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="dislike" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   Indicates that the actor dislikes the object. Note that the
   "dislike" verb is distinct from the "unlike" verb which assumes
   that the object had been previously "liked".
  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="experience" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   Indicates that the actor has experienced the object in some
   manner. Note that, depending on the specific object types used for
   both the actor and object, the meaning of this verb can overlap
