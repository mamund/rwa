 <description>
  ALPS descriptions of the object types and verbs defined by the
  Activity Schema draft. These may be treated as a grab bag of
  standardized names for the objects ("event", "comment", "review")
  and state transitions ("acknowledge", "dislike", "follow") typically
  found in human-facing web applications.

  The Activity Streams standard defines the object type "activity" and
  the generic "post" event; they can be found in the corresponding
  ALPS document.

  Object types ("event") can be used either as safe link relations...

<div class="object">
 <a class="url" href="http://www.example.com/events/44" rel="event">
  Birthday party
 </a>
</div>

 ...or as semantic descriptors:

<div class="event">
 Date: <span class="start">July 20, 2014</span>
</div>

  Verbs ("acknowledge") are defined as unsafe link relations:

<form action="/g555" method="POST" class="acknowledge">
 <input type="Submit" value="Acknowledge receipt of this notice."/>
</form>

  All verbs are defined as "unsafe" even though this may not be true
  for a particular application. That is, a transition like "share"
  might be unsafe or idempotent, depending on the application. [TK we
  should make our own value judgements; the Activity Schema explicitly
  mentions that "join" is idempotent but omits that kind of language
  for other things that are pretty clearly idempotent.]

 <element id="experience" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   Indicates that the actor has experienced the object in some
   manner. Note that, depending on the specific object types used for

   that of the "consume" and "play" verbs. For instance, a person
   might "experience" a movie; or "play" the movie; or "consume" the

   identical "follow" activities.
  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="give" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   Indicates that the actor is giving an object to the

  </description>
 </element>

 <element id="like" type="unsafe">

 </element>

 <element id="listen" type="unsafe">
  <description>
   Indicates that the actor has listened to the object. This is
   typically only applicable for objects representing audio content,

   object. Since this verb implies an activity on the part of its
   object, processors MUST NOT accept activities with this verb unless
   they are able to verify through some external means that there is
   in fact a reciprocated connection. For example, a processor may
   have received a guarantee from a particular publisher that the
   publisher will only use this Verb in cases where a reciprocal
   relationship exists.

   The "negative RSVP" verb indicates that the actor has made a
   negative RSVP for the object. This specification only defines the
   meaning of this verb when its object is an event, though
   implementors SHOULD be prepared to handle other object types as
   meaning MAY be provided by extension specifications. The use of
   this verb is only appropriate when the RSVP was created by an
   explicit action by the actor. It is not appropriate to use this
   verb when a user has been added as an attendee by an event
   organiser or administrator.
