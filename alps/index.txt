= Application-Level Profile Semantics =
Revision: 2012-10-29 (mca)

Some topics for conversation.

1. I would like to discuss the addition of a +parent+ element,
analogous to +child+. This would allow one ALPS document to
unilaterally extend another.

I used this heavily in my first draft of the ALPS version of Activity
Streams. When an extension element extended 'activity', I said that
its parent was the #activity object in another file. Similarly for
#object.

Then I decided to take a more laid-back, microformats-ish
approach. Now the extension elements can be used anywhere. I feel that
this is a better approach, because it means the elements are much more
reusable. But I think there's still be a case for #parent.

The main problem with this (apart from implementation difficulties) is
that the attributes look weird:

<element id="foo"
 <parent href="http://other.doc/#bar" appears="MAY"
  cardinality="many"/>
</element>

This makes it sound like a +foo+ may have zero, one or more parents,
each of which is a +bar+. When actually it's saying that a +foo+ may
appear zero, one, or many times within a +bar+.

2. Because of that, I would like to explore the possibility of
replacing +child+ and +parent+ with a generic +link+.

<element id="foo">
 <link rel="parent" href="http://other.doc/#bar" appears="MAY"
  cardinality="many"/>
</element>

This would make ALPS into a general hypermedia format. +appears+ and
cardinality would only make sense for +child+ and +parent+.

The disadvantage (it's a big disadvantage) is extra verbosity and lack
of clarity in the common case.

If you don't like this, what about allowing a general +link+ with
+rel+ as an extension mechanism.

3. A lot of semantic descriptors also make sense as link
relations. The "inventory" descriptor from the treasure hunt is
defined as a link relation, and as the name of the top-level tag you
find when you follow the link.

While working on the Activity Streams translation I discovered that
*most* semantic descriptors could be used as safe link
relations. For "event", "collection", "location", even "longitude", it
might make sense to either include the value inline or link to a
standalone resource whose representation provides the value.

I think the ALPS spec should say that a semantic descriptor can be
used as a safe link relation. If the name of a descriptor conflicts
with an IANA-registered link relation, the local name takes
precedence. (This is the only way to prevent a situation where
additions to IANA change the meaning of preexisting ALPS documents.)

<a href="foo" rel="event">

->

<span class="event">
 ...
</span>

Alternatively, we could say that a semantic descriptor applied to a
hypermedia link "types" the link.

<a href="foo" class="event" rel="somethingelse">

->

<span class="event">
 ...
</span>

But that seems to reinvent the work done by the link relation. And I
don't know if there's support in all our target representation formats
for applying semantic descriptors (as opposed to link relations) to
links.

4. There are two big difficulties with making an ALPS version of
Activity Streams.

4a. Every object is supposed to have an "objectType" attribute. For
each provided value for "objectType" (e.g. "event", "game"), I defined
a combination link relation/semantic descriptor.  But there's no way
in ALPS to indicate that a certain semantic descriptor is expected to
be used as a value for "objectType".

To approximate this I got rid of objectType and mentioned in the
definition of "url" that any hypermedia control with descriptor "url"
should set its link relation to reflect the object type on the other
end.

<div class="object">"
 <a class="url" href="http://www.example.com/events/44" rel="event">
  Birthday party
 </a>
</div>

"event" is not technically a relationship, but neither is "inventory".

But there's still no way of saying within ALPS that _those particular_
link relations are intended to be the partial range of "url"'s link
relation.

4b. Every activity has a "verb" associated with it which serves the
same purpose as objectType. It explains what kind of activity this
is. e.g. "consume", "checkin", "dislike".

I defined an unsafe link relation for every verb, but there's no way
in ALPS to explain that those link relations are intended to be the
partial range of the "verb" descriptor.

I don't think we should extend ALPS to deal with these two problems,
but does it make sense to define an Activity Streams-specific
extension?

 <element id="checkin" type="unsafe verb">
 <element id="game" type="safe descriptor objectType">

5. Given the prevalence of the collection pattern, it may make sense
to allow an ALPS document to hint that a given descriptor describes a
collection rather than a single object. We could do this e.g. by
defining "collection" as another type, a subtype of "descriptor".

 <element id="vcalendar" type="collection" appears="MAY">
   <description>
     A calendar of events.
   </description>
   <child href="#event"/ cardinality="many">
 </element>

I don't know if this feature would really be useful.

== Summary ==

This document describes a media type for defining application-level
semantic descriptions (similar to those defined by HTML microformats)
in a way that incorporates both human-readable documentation and
machine-readable instructions on applying semantic descriptions to
elements within application-agnostic media-type representations (such
as HTML, HAL, Collection+JSON, and Siren). This document also sets a
standard for creating and registering ALPS document identifers and
provides suggested conventions for applying ALPS descriptors to
existing media types.

This document registers two media-type identifiers with the IANA:
+application/vnd.alps+xml+ ("ALPS+XML") and
+application/vnd.alps+json+ ("ALPS+JSON").

== Simple Example ==

[TK]

== Motivation ==

When implementing a hypermedia client/server application using a
general media type (i.e. HTML, Atom, Collection+JSON, etc.), client
and server instances need to share application-specific information
such as data element names, link relation values, and state transfer
parameters. This information is directly related to the application
being implemented (i.e. accounting, contact management, etc.) rather
than the media type used in the representations.

Instead of creating (and registering) an entirely new media type (i.e.
+application/accounting+), representation authors can use an ALPS
"profile" to apply application-level semantic descriptions to elements
defined by the generic media type. This increases the specificity of
the representation without reducing the generality of the media type.

== Identifying an ALPS Document ==

ALPS vocabularies are identified by a unique URI. This URI can be in the form 
of a resolvable URL (i.e. +http://example.org/alps/accounting+) or it can be 
in the form of a URN (i.e. TK).

If the identifier is a URL, it SHOULD point to a valid ALPS document. the URL 
MAY point to a human-readable document that describes the ALPS specification 
for the identified use case.  If the identifier is a URN, it SHOULD NOT be 
treated as a resolvable identifer and instead SHOULD be treated as a unique 
name for the identified use case. 

[I almost feel like we should have two URLs, an ALPS permalink and a
human-readable doc. Or should we suggest the use of content
negotiation? -leonardr]

All ALPS URIs MUST be unique and all ALPS documents intended for
public consumption SHOULD be registered in the ALPS Registry located
at [TK].

== ALPS Documents ==

ALPS Documents contain a machine-readable collection of semantic
descriptors and their human-readable details. An ALPS document can be
represented in either XML or JSON format. This section identifies the
general elements and properties of an ALPS document, their meaning,
and their use. Additional subsections provide specific details on how
to construct a valid ALPS document in XML and in JSON format.

=== Compliance ===

An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more of the 
MUST or REQUIRED level requirements. An implementation that satisfies all 
the MUST or REQUIRED level and all the SHOULD level requirements is said 
to be "unconditionally compliant"; one that satisfies all the MUST level 
requirements but not all the SHOULD level requirements is said to be 
"conditionally compliant."

[NOTE]
===========================================
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", 
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to 
be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
===========================================

=== ALPS Document Properties ===

The ALPS media type defines a small set of properties. The properties
appear in both the XML and JSON formats, but are expressed in
different ways. Below is a list of the properties that can appear in
an ALPS document.

==== +alps+ ====
Indicates the root of the ALPS document. This MUST be the first property
in the document. This property SHOULD have one or more +element+ child 
properties.

[Would it be okay to remove the 'must be the first property in the
document' requirement? This would allow an ALPS doc to be embedded in
other docs. It would also make it possible to define ALPS as a
microformat. -leonardr]

==== +appears+ ====

Indicates the appearance rules to apply to the related +element+.
Valid values for this element are: 'MUST', 'SHOULD', and 'MAY'. These
values are to be treated as defined in RFC 2119. The +appears+
property SHOULD appear as a property of the +element+ and/or +child+
elements. If this property does not appear, the value SHOULD be
treated as 'MAY'.

[You've removed MUST NOT and the default MUST NOT for top-level
elements, which makes it difficult to define documents like
hCalendar. I've written an alternate section below. -leonardr]

Indicates the appearance rules for the related +element+ in a
representation. All valid values for this property are terms defined in RFC
2119, and have the meaning given in that standard.

The +appears+ property MAY appear as a property of the +element+
block. This controls whether the element may appear at the "top
level"; that is, not enclosed in any other element defined by this
ALPS document. The formal meaning of "top level" varies by the media
type; see "Applying ALPS to Existing Media Types" for
definitions. [that's TK -leonardr]

Valid values for +appears+ in an +element+ block are: 'MUST',
'SHOULD', 'MAY', and 'MUST NOT'. If this property does not appear, the
value SHOULD be treated as 'MUST NOT'.

The +appears+ property MAY appear as a property of a +child+
block. This controls the rules by which the referenced element may
appear as a child of the enclosing +element+. The formal meaning of
"enclosing +element+" varies by the media type; see "Applying ALPS to
Existing Media Types" for definitions. [that's TK -leonardr]

Valid values for +appears+ in an +child+ block are: 'MUST',
'SHOULD', and 'MAY'. If this property does not appear, the value
SHOULD be treated as 'MAY'.

==== +cardinality+ ====

Indicates the number of times the related +element+ can appear. Valid
values are 'single' and 'many'.

The +cardinality+ property MAY appear as a property of an +element+
block. This controls how many times that element may be used at the
"top level" within a single representation.

The +cardinality+ property MAY appear as a property of a +child+
block. This controls how many times the child element may occur within
its enclosing element.

If this property does not appear, the value SHOULD be treated as
'many'.

==== +child+ ====

Links to a child element of the related +element+ This MAY appear in
the ALPS document as a child of an +element+ block. The +child+
property MAY have an +href+ property pointing to a definition of an
+element+ block (see +href+ for details).

If no +href+ appears, then the +child+ property takes on the same
features as the +element+ property. [Which ones? It would also be good
to mention here which properties the +child+ tag supports, as you do for
+element+. -leonardr]

==== +description+ ====

A text field that contains free-form, usually human-readable, text.

A +description+ block SHOULD appear as a child of +element+. When
present, it describes the meaning and use of the related +element+.

A +description+ block MAY appear as a child of +child+. When present,
it describes the meaning of the relationship between the +element+ and
its +child+.

A +description+ block MAY appear as a child of +alps+. When present,
it describes the purpose of the ALPS document as a whole.

[When writing the example docs I kept wanting to use HTML
markup. Obviously you can do this in ALPS+XML by using namespaces. Can
we explicitly say that the contents of +description+ may be HTML
markup, a la the contents of an Atom story? -leonardr]

==== +element+ ====

Identifies a semantic descriptor. One or more +element+ blocks SHOULD
appear as children of the +alps+ property.

This property MUST have the following properties:

 * +id+
 * +type+

It SHOULD have the following properties:

 * +appears+

It MAY have the following properties:

 * +cardinality+
 * +child+
 * +description+
 * +name+

==== +name+ ====

Indicates the name of the +element+ as found in generic
representations. It MAY appear as a property of the +element+.

This is used when the +element+'s name is used as an +id+ value
elsewhere in the ALPS document. For instance, if a single ALPS
document defines an element descriptor called 'customer' and a
safe-idempotent control called 'customer', they can't both have
+id="customer"+ in the ALPS document. One of them needs to have some
other +id+, and to set +name="customer"+.

==== +href+ ====

Points to an +element+ either within the existing ALPS document or in
another ALPS document.

The +href+ attribute MUST appear as part of the +child+ element. The
value MUST be a valid URL, with a fragment identifier, resolving to an
+element+ within an ALPS document.

[Should <alps> itself support +href+ so it can link to itself or a
full human-readable doc? Or should we allow a general <link> tag so
you can do rel="help"?]

\[ Earlier you said that +child+ didn't need href. -leonardr \]

[I have a half-baked idea about using +href+ within +element+ as well.
This would let you copy the +fn+ descriptor defined in hCard into your
custom ALPS document (for performance reasons) but still make it clear
that your +fn+ descriptor has the same meaning as the one defined in
hCard. -leonardr]

==== +id+ ====

A document-wide unique identifier for the related element. This MUST
appear as a property of each +element+.

The value of this property will appear within generic representations
as the name of a semantic descriptor or hypermedia control (see
Applying ALPS to Existing Media Types for details). The exception is
when an element defines +name+ as well as +id+. In that case, the
value of +name+ contains the name of the semantic descriptor or
hypermedia control, and the value of +id+ is just a unique ID.

When applied to an ALPS document, a URI fragment identifier points to
the element with the appropriate +id+. For example, The fragment
identifier +customer+ in the URI +http://example.com/#customer+ refers
to an ALPS element with +id+ set to +customer+.

A relative URL with a fragment identifier (e.g. "#customer") refers to
an element within the ALPS document containing the reference.

==== +type+ ====

Indicates the type of representation control to which the +element+ is
applied. This MUST appear for each +element+. Four values are defined:

\[ Would it be OK to say that the default is 'descriptor'? -leonardr \]

 * 'descriptor' refers to a state element (e.g. +HTML.SPAN+, +HTML.INPUT+, etc.).
 * 'safe-idempotent' refers to a hypermedia control that triggers a safe,
idempotent state transition (i.e. +HTTP.GET+, +HTTP.HEAD+, etc.).
 * 'unsafe-idempotent' refers to a hypermedia control that triggers an
unsafe, idempotent state transition (i.e. +HTTP.PUT+, +HTTP.DELETE+ etc.).
 * 'unsafe-nonidempotent' refers to a hypermedia control that triggers an
unsafe, non-idempotent state transition (i.e. +HTTP.POST+).

\[ How about just idempotent and nonidempotent? -leonardr \]

==== +version+ ====
Indicates the version number of the ALPS document. This SHOULD appear as a 
property of the +alps+ property. Currently the only valid value is '1.0'. 
If no value appears, then it SHOULD be set to '1.0'.

=== XML Representation ===

The following example shows how ALPS Elements are expressed in the XML
format. This example ALPS+XML document describes a portion of the
hCalendar microformat (http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar).

[I put this in because I think an example that ties into something
preexisting is better than an example we made up for RWA.]

---------------------------------
<alps version="1.0">

 <description>
  hCalendar is a simple, open format for publishing events on the web,
  using a 1:1 representation of iCalendar (RFC2445) VEVENT properties

  <description>
   A container for one or more events (vevent).

---------------------------------

This ALPS+XML document describes the +rel-nofollow+ microformat
(http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-nofollow):

[And I put this other example in because hCalendar doesn't define any link
relations. -leonardr]

---------------------------------
<alps version="1.0">
 <element id="nofollow" type="safe-idempotent">
  <description>

   by the author of the page, and thus said reference should not afford
   the referred resource any additional weight or ranking by user
   agents.

---------------------------------
=== JSON Representation ===
Below shows how ALPS Elements are expressed in the JSON format. 

[NOTE]
======
In the JSON format, the +element+ and +child+ properties are each expressed 
as an +ARRAY+ and are labeled +elements+ and +children+ respectively.
======

[I think this should be more formally defined. The property
descriptions are hard to read because terms like "child" and "element"
are used for both the ALPS doc and for the generic doc the ALPS doc
describes. Then there's this extra genericness when defining things
like +element+ because we can't use XML-specific terminology like
"tag".

I liked your use of "block" instead of "tag" when defining
+element+. If we consistently use, say, "block" and "attribute", then
when we talk about XML and JSON representations we can say that a
block becomes a tag in XML but a list in JSON, and an attribute
becomes an XML attribute but a key-value pair in a JSON
dictionary. -leonardr]

== Applying ALPS to Existing Media Types ==

ALPS documents can be applied to many existing hypermedia types. Below
are a set of instructions on how to apply ALPS information to existing
media types.

[There's an issue of policy here. I've written two paragraphs. Each
has its own problems. I think I have to vote for #1. -leonardr]

These instructions are to be considered normative for ALPS version
1.0. If the body responsible for a given media type adopts conflicting
instructions for applying an ALPS document to that media type, a new
revision of the ALPS standard will be released which references that
body's instructions.

OR

These instructions are not to be considered normative. If the body
responsible for a given media type adopts conflicting instructions for
applying an ALPS document to that media type, those instructions
should take precedence.


=== ALPS and HTML ===

The following rules apply when applying ALPS to HTML. (That is, to
documents with media type +text/html+ or +application/xhtml+xml+.)

'descriptor' :: The element's name refers to the +"class"+ attribute
of an element. If the descriptor is a +child+ of a transition, the
element SHOULD be a +<INPUT>+, +<SELECT>+, or +<TEXTAREA>+ element.

'safe-idempotent' :: The element's name refers to the +"class"+
attribute of a +<FORM>+ which has its +"method"+" attribute set to
+get+.  The names of any +child+ descriptors refer to the +"class"+
attributes of +<INPUT>+, +<SELECT>+, and/or +<TEXTAREA>+ elements
encapsulated by the +<FORM>+.

If no +child+ descriptors exist, the descriptor name may also be applied
to the +"rel"+ attribute of an +<A>+ or +<LINK>+ element.

[I think this should be applied to the class of the submit button, not
the form itself, because a form may contain more than one submit
button. But, it might be okay to say that it can be applied to the
form or to a submit button. -leonardr]

'unsafe-idempotent' :: Treated as equivalent to 'unsafe-nonidempotent'.

'unsafe-nonidempotent' :: The element's name refers to the
+"class"+ attribute of a +<FORM>+ which has its +"method"+ attribute
set to +post+. The names of any +child+ descriptors refer to the
+"class"+ attributes of +<INPUT>+, +<SELECT>+, and/or +<TEXTAREA>+
elements encapsulated by the +<FORM>+.

==== NOTES ====

Since HTML has no support for idempotent state transitions per se,
this standard treats them the same as non-idempotent state
transitions. Both are represented as HTML forms with +method="post"+.

[I think this is better than leaving it undefined, but I'm open to
counterarguments. -leonardr]

=== ALPS and Collection+JSON ===

The following rules apply when applying ALPS to Collection+JSON. (That
is, to documents with media type +application/vnd.collection+json+.)

'descriptor' :: The element name refers to the +"name"+ property of a 
+{"data"}+ object.

'safe-idemptotent' :: The element name refers to the +"rel"+ property of 
a +{"link"}+ object.

'unsafe-idempotent' :: The element name refers to the +"rel"+ of a 
+{"template"}+ object.

'unsafe-nonidempotent' :: Undefined for Collection+JSON.

==== NOTES ====

Since Collection+JSON does not support non-idempotent transitions, it
is up to the application implementor how and whether to represent this
transition in a Collection+JSON representation.

=== ALPS and HAL ===

When applying ALPS to HAL (both XML and JSON formats), the folloiwng
rules apply.

'descriptor' :: The element name refers to the "name" attribute of an item.

'safe-idempotent' :: The element name refers to the "rel" of a link element.

'unsafe-idempotent' :: The element name refers to the "rel" of a link element.

'unsafe-nonidempotent' :: The element name refers to the "rel" of a 
link element.

==== NOTES ====

HAL does not identify the protocol-level details of a state transition
(safe/unsafe, idempotent/non-idempotent) within a
representation. Instead that information is in the human-readable
documentation associated with the link relation value. For this
reason, it is important to reference the application's documentation
after determining which ALPS element name applies to a HAL +<LINK>+
element.

[WARNING]
=========================================
MCA: I stopped editing at this point. The Siren+JSON, Atom, and OData
sections still need to be brought up-to-date with the rest of the spec.

LEONARDR: I also stopped here when going through it.
=========================================

=== ALPS and Siren ===
When appying ALPS to Siren, the following rules apply.

 * 'unique' : Undefined. (Alternately: the same as "descriptor")
 * 'descriptor' : On the top level, element ID refers to the "class" of an entity.
Within an entity, element ID refers to the "class" of a sub-entity, or
to a key within the entity's 'properties' dictionary. [TK uneasy about
this one, but it seems to require both.]
 * 'link-relation' : Within an entity, element ID refers to the "rel" of an
item in the entity's "links" dictionary, or to the "rel" attribute of
a sub-entity. Alternatively, the Element ID may refer to the "class" of an item in
the entity's "actions" dictionary, so long as the action's "method" is
GET. If this is the case, sub-elements of type "descriptor" refer to
values for "name" in the action's "fields" dictionary.
 * 'idempotent-relation'
 * 'unsafe-relation' : Within an entity, element ID
refers to the "class" of an item in the entity's "actions"
dictionary. For "idempotent-relation", the action's "method" must be
GET, PUT, or DELETE. For "unsafe-relation", any method is acceptable.

Sub-elements of type "descriptor" refer to values for "name" in the
action's "fields" dictionary.

=== ALPS and Atom ===
When applying ALPS to Atom, the following rules apply.

=== ALPS and OData ===
When applying ALPS to OData, the following rules apply.

=== Linking to ALPS documents ===

When a representation links to an ALPS document describing its
semantics, the "describedBy" link relation (found in the IANA link
registry) SHOULD be used to describe the relationship between the
representation and the ALPS document.

A single representation may be "describedBy" more than one ALPS
document. If two ALPS documents give conflicting semantics for the
same element, the document linked to earlier in the representation
SHOULD take precedence.
