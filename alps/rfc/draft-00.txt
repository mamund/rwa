               Application-Level Profile Semantics (ALPS)
                   draft-amundsen-richardson-alps-00

Abstract

   This document describes ALPS, a data format for describing sets of
   application-level semantics.  An ALPS document can be used as a
   profile to explain the application-level meaning of a document with
   an application-agnostic media type (such as HTML, HAL, Collection+
   JSON, or Siren).  This increases the reusability of profile documents
   across media types.

Internet-Draft     Application-Level Profile Semantics    September 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document describes ALPS, a media type for describing sets of
   application-level semantics.  These descriptions focus on organizing
   human-readable explanations of the semantics in a machine-readable
   way.  The expressive capability of an ALPS document is similar to
   that of an HTML microformat definition.

   An ALPS document can be used as a profile to explain the application
   semantics of a document with an application-agnostic media type (such
   as HTML, HAL, Collection+JSON, or Siren).

   This document identifies a registry for ALPS documents, and sets a
   standard for creating and registering ALPS document identifiers with
   that registry.

   This document also identifies a registry for normative human-readable
   instructions on applying an ALPS document as a profile to a document
   with a given media type.  It sets a standard for registering media
   types with that registry.  It gives some non-normative examples in
   which a single ALPS document is applied as a profile to documents
   with different media types.

   This document registers two media-type identifiers with the IANA:
   'application/alps+xml' ("ALPS+XML") and 'application/alps+json'
   ("ALPS+JSON").

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Motivation

   To implement a hypermedia client/server application using a general
   media type (HTML, Atom, Collection+JSON, etc.), client and server
   instances must share an understanding of the application domain.
   This typically takes the form of an agreed-upon mapping between real-
   world concepts and data element names, link relation values, and
   state transfer parameters.  This information is directly related to
   the application being implemented (e.g. accounting or contact
   management) rather than the media type used in the representations.

1.2.1.  Describing Domain-Specific Semantics

   Instead of creating and registering an entirely new media type (e.g.
   'application/accounting'), representation authors can create an ALPS

Internet-Draft     Application-Level Profile Semantics    September 2013


   document that describes a "profile" of the target domain: one that
   explains the mapping between data element names and state
   transitions, and the real-world concepts they describe.

   ALPS focuses on defining application-level semantics, independent of
   transfer protocol or media type.  This makes it possible to serve
   application-specific representations using an application-agnostic
   media type.

   Any document can bring in an ALPS document as a profile, using the
   "profile" link relation defined in RFC 6906.

1.2.2.  ALPS-based Server Implementations

   Server implementors can use ALPS documents as a basis for building
   domain-specific solutions without having to create their own custom
   media type or re-invent the vocabulary and transition set for a
   common domain (e.g. accounting or microblogging).  Using a
   preexisting ALPS profile as a guide, servers can map internal data to
   commonly-understood semantic descriptors and state transitions,
   increasing the likelihood that existing client applications (those
   who share the same understanding of the ALPS document) will be able
   to successfully interact with that server.

1.2.3.  ALPS-based Client Implementations

   Armed with a document's ALPS profile, client applications can
   identify the link relations and semantic descriptors within the
   document, and map them to real-world concepts.  Client applications
   can "code for the profile" and better adjust to detailed changes to
   the response layout, or even the wholesale replacement of one media
   type with another.

1.3.  A Simple ALPS Example

   Below is an ALPS document that describes elements of a contact
   management application.  The profile defines a semantic descriptor
   called "contact", which contains three subordinate semantic
   descriptors ("fullName", "email", and "phone").

   The ALPS document also defines a single, safe transition descriptor
   with the 'id' value of "collection", to be represented by a
   hypermedia control (e.g.  HTML.GET form).  Whatever form it takes,
   this hypermedia control will include one input value ("nameSearch").
   When a client executes the transition, the response will contain one
   or more "contact" type items.  [TK Does rt mean one or more?  I
   thought it meant one. -LR]

                     HTML ALPS Contact Representation

   This document uses a number of values for HTML's "class" attribute

   which are seemingly never explained: "contacts", "contact",
   "fullName", and so on.  Values like this are commonly explained with
   a CSS file, brought in using the IANA link relation "stylesheet".
   There is no "stylesheet" link here, but, there is a "profile" link
   which brings in the ALPS document seen above.  That document explains
   "contact", "fullName", and the rest of the "class" attributes, not in
   terms of how they should affect an HTML rendering engine (as a CSS
   stylesheet would), but in terms of the real-world things that
   "contact" and "fullName" refer to.

   The rules for applying an ALPS profile to an HTML 4 document make
   heavy use of HTML's "class" attribute, taking inspiration from
   microformats.  This HAL document uses the same profile to express the
   same application semantics as the HTML document, in a different way.

                      HAL XML Contacts Representation

   In a HAL document, data descriptors like "fullName" and "email",
   which were CSS classes in the HTML 4 representation, are represented
   with XML tags named after the descriptors.

   This Collection+JSON document uses the ALPS profile to express the
   same application-level semantics as the HTML and HAL documents.

                  Collection+JSON Contacts Representation

   The descriptors "fullName", "email", and "phone" have become the
   names of key-value pairs in the items in a Collection+JSON
   collection.  The descriptor "fullName" is also used as an input value
   to a search query.  The descriptor "contact" has become the resource
   type ("rt") of the items in the collection.

1.4.  Identifying an ALPS Document

   An ALPS vocabulary is identified by a unique URL.  A vocabulary's URL
   MUST resolve to a valid ALPS document describing it, if an HTTP
   client requests one through content negotiation.  The URL MAY also
   resolve to documents describing the vocabulary in other formats, and
   there is no requirement that the URL resolve to an ALPS document by
   default.

   A client SHOULD NOT automatically resolve an ALPS vocabulary URL, to
   avoid overburdening its server.

   All ALPS URLs MUST be unique [TK what does that mean exactly? -LR]
   and all ALPS documents intended for public consumption SHOULD be
   registered with the ALPS Registry (see Section 4).

2.  ALPS Documents

   An ALPS document contains a machine-readable collection of
   identifying strings and their human-readable explanations.  An ALPS
   document can be represented in either XML or JSON format.  This
   section identifies the general elements and properties of an ALPS
   document, their meaning, and their use, independent of how the
   document is represented.  Section 2.3 provides specific details on
   constructing a valid ALPS document in XML and in JSON format.

2.1.  Compliance

   An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more
   of the MUST or REQUIRED level requirements.  An implementation that
   satisfies all the MUST or REQUIRED level and all the SHOULD level
   requirements is said to be "unconditionally compliant"; one that
   satisfies all the MUST level requirements but not all the SHOULD

2.2.  ALPS Document Properties

   The ALPS media type defines a small set of properties.  These
   properties appear in both the XML and JSON formats.  Below is a list
   of the properties that can appear in an ALPS document.

2.2.1.  'alps'

   Indicates the root of the ALPS document.  This property is REQUIRED,
   and it SHOULD have one or more 'descriptor' (Section 2.2.3) child
   properties.

   Examples:

   XML:  <alps>...</alps>

   JSON:  {"alps" : ... }

2.2.2.  'doc'

   A text field that contains free-form, usually human-readable, text.
   The 'doc' element MAY have two properties: 'href' (Section 2.2.6) and
   'format' (Section 2.2.5).  If the 'href' property appears it SHOULD
   contain a dereferencable URL that points to human-readable text.  If
   the 'format' property appears it SHOULD contain one of three
   allowable values:

   1.  "text"

   2.  "html"

   3.  "ascidoc"

   Any program processing "doc" elements SHOULD honor the "format"
   directive and parse/render the content appropriately.  If the value
   in the "format" property is not recognized and/or supported, the
   processing program MUST treat the content as plain text.  If no
   'format' property is present, the content SHOULD be treated as plain
   text.

   XML:  <description format="html"> <h1>Date of Birth</h1> <p>...</p>
      </description>

   JSON:  {"description" : {"format" : "text" : "value" : "Date of Birth
      ..."} }

   A 'doc' element SHOULD appear as a child of 'descriptor'
   (Section 2.2.3).  When present, it describes the meaning and use of

   the related 'descriptor'.

   XML:  <element ... > <description>...</description> </element>

   JSON:  {"element" : {...} {"description" : {"value" : "..."} }

   The 'doc' element MAY appear as a child of 'alps' (Section 2.2.1).
   When present, it describes the purpose of the ALPS document as a
   whole.

   XML:  <alps> <description>...</description> ... </apls>

   JSON:  {"alps : "description" : { "value" : "..."}, ... }

   [TK Maybe we should allow 'doc' beneath 'ext'?  Since 'ext' is kind
   of a variant on 'descriptor'? -LR]

2.2.3.  'descriptor'

   Identifies a semantic or transition descriptor.  One or more
   'descriptor' elements SHOULD appear as children of 'alps'
   (Section 2.2.1).  It may also appear as a child of itself; that is,
   the 'descriptor' property may be nested.

   The 'descriptor' property MAY have either an 'id' (Section 2.2.7) or
   'href' (Section 2.2.6) attribute.  It MAY have both.  Additionally,
   the 'descriptor' MAY have any of the following attributes:

   1.  'doc' (Section 2.2.2)

   2.  'ext' (Section 2.2.4)

   3.  'name' (Section 2.2.9)

   4.  'type' (Section 2.2.12)

   If present, the 'href' property MUST be a dereferenceable URL that
   points to another 'descriptor', either within the current ALPS
   document or in another ALPS document.

   A 'descriptor' that has an 'href' attribute inherits all the
   attributes and sub-properties of the 'descriptor' pointed to by
   'href'.  Any property value explicitly defined by a 'descriptor'
   takes precedence over an inhereted value.  Since there is no limit to
   the nesting of elements -- even ones linked remotely -- it is
   important to process all 'descriptor' chains starting from the bottom
   to make sure you have collected all the available properties for a
   'descriptor' and have established the correct value for each of them.

2.2.4.  'ext'

   The 'ext' element can be used to extend the ALPS document with
   author-specific information.  It provides a way to customize ALPS
   documents with additional properties not covered in this
   specification.  This is an OPTIONAL element.

   The 'ext' element has two properties.  The 'href' (Section 2.2.6)
   property MUST appear for the 'ext' element.  Its value MUST be a URI
   and the URI SHOULD be resolveable.  The 'value' (Section 2.2.13)
   property MAY appear for the 'ext' element.  The meaning and use of
   the value property is described in the document found by
   dereferencing the 'href' property of the 'ext' element.  [TK what if
   it's not resolvable?  Also, the definition of 'href' in general says
   it must be resolvable. -leonardr]

   Examples:

   XML:  <ext href="http://alps.io/ext/directions" value="north south
      east west" >

   JSON:  {"ext" : {"href" : "http://alps.io/ext/directions",
      value="north south east west"}}

   The 'ext' element MAY appear as a child of the following elements:

   1.  'alps' (Section 2.2.1)

   2.  'descriptor' (Section 2.2.3)

   Since the 'ext' element has no specific meaning within this
   specification, it MUST be ignored by any application that does not
   understand its meaning.

   Authors who define 'ext' elements SHOULD register these extensions
   with the ALPS Registry (see Section 4) and use the URI provided by
   the registry in the 'name' property of their extension.

2.2.5.  'format'

   Indicates how the text content should be parsed and/or rendered.
   This version of the spec identifies three possible values for
   "format": "text", "html", and "asciidoc."  Any other calues for this
   attribute are undefined and SHOULD be treated as plain text.  If the
   program does not recognize the value of the "format" property and/or
   the "format" property is missing, the content SHOULD be treated as
   plain text.  This property MAY appear as an attribute of the 'doc'
   (Section 2.2.2) element.

Internet-Draft     Application-Level Profile Semantics    September 2013


2.2.6.  'href'

   Contains a resolvable URL.

   When it appears as an attribute of 'descriptor' (Section 2.2.3),
   'href' points to another 'descriptor' either within the existing ALPS
   document or in another ALPS document.

   When it appears as an attribute of 'ext' (Section 2.2.4), 'href'
   points to an external document which provides the defintion of the
   extension.

   When it appears as an attribute of 'link' (Section 2.2.8) 'href'
   points to an external document whose relationship to the current
   document or 'descriptor' is described by the associated 'rel'
   (Section 2.2.10) property.

   When it appears as an attribute of 'doc' (Section 2.2.2), 'href'
   points to a document containing human-readable text that describes
   the associated 'descriptor' or ALPS document.

2.2.7.  'id'

   A document-wide unique identifier for the related element.  This MAY
   appear as an attribute of an 'descriptor' (Section 2.2.3).

   The value of this attribute will appear within generic
   representations as the name of a data element or hypermedia control
   (see Section 3 for details).  The exception is when a 'descriptor'
   defines 'name' (Section 2.2.9) as well as 'id' (Section 2.2.7).  In
   that case, the value of 'name' contains the name of the data element
   hypermedia control, and the value of 'id' is just a unique identifier
   internal to the ALPS document.

   When applied to an ALPS document, a URI fragment identifier points to
   the 'descriptor' with the appropriate 'id'.  For example, the
   fragment identifier "customer" in the URI
   http://example.com/#customer refers to the ALPS 'descriptor' with
   'id' set to "customer".

   A relative URL with a fragment identifier (e.g. "#customer") refers
   to an 'descriptor' within the ALPS document containing the reference.

   The complete URI to an ALPS 'descriptor' (including the fragemnt
   identifier) forms an "abstract semantic type" identifier.  This is a
   resolvable URI (a URL) that can be used to indicate the type of a
   resource.  For instance, it can be used as the value of the IANA-
   registered link relation "type".

Internet-Draft     Application-Level Profile Semantics    September 2013


   A 'descriptor' that defines a state transition establishes an
   extension link relation whose name is the unqualified URI of the
   descriptor. (e.g. rel="http://example.com/#purchased-by") However,
   within representations that include the defining ALPS document as a
   profile, the descriptor's 'id' may be used on its own as a registered
   link relation. (e.g. rel="purchased-by")

   For this reason, when selecting 'id' values and defining 'descriptor'
   semantics, users SHOULD NOT create conflicts with existing IANA-
   registered values.

   If it is unclear whether a registered link relation in a
   representation document refers to a relation registered with IANA or
   a relation registered in an ALPS profile, the relation in the ALPS
   profile takes precedence.  [TK that's what we said in the book,
   anyway. -LR] This allows the meaning of an ALPS document to remain
   unchanged when new link relations are added to the IANA registry.

2.2.8.  'link'

   Identifies a link between the current ALPS element and some other
   (possibly external) resource.  Can be applied to the 'alps'
   (Section 2.2.1) and the 'descriptor' (Section 2.2.3) elements.

   The 'link' property MUST define the two attributes 'href'
   (Section 2.2.6) and 'rel' (Section 2.2.10).

2.2.9.  'name'

   Indicates the name of the 'descriptor' (Section 2.2.3) as found in
   generic representations.  It MAY appear as a property of
   'descriptor'.

   This is used when the name of the 'descriptor' is used as an 'id'
   (Section 2.2.7) value elsewhere in the ALPS document.  For instance,
   if a single ALPS document defines a semantic descriptor called
   "customer" and a safe-idempotent control called "customer", they
   can't both have 'id="customer"' in the ALPS document.  One of them
   needs to have some other 'id', and to set 'name="customer"'.

   The use of the 'name' property usually indicates an ambiguity in the
   application semantics.  Thus, it SHOULD only be used when creating an
   ALPS profile that describes an existing design.

2.2.10.  'rel'

   Contains a [RFC5988] approved value: either an extension link
   relation (a URI) or a registered link relation (a short string).

   Appears as a property of link (Section 2.2.8).

   A link relation defined within an ALPS document MAY NOT be used as a
   registered link relation within the same ALPS document.  [TK MAY NOT
   or SHOULD NOT? -mca :: I think MAY NOT.  I don't want an ALPS
   document to be used to describe itself.  But I had to think for a
   while to remember the rationale for this. -leonardr]

2.2.11.  'rt'

   [TK I noticed you added rt to the example but it wasn't defined here.
   I'm also not convinced we need to add rt to ALPS itself, as opposed
   to saying it's OK to use ALPS URIs as rt in other formats. -leonardr]
   :: [ok, let's talk about this one. i figured using this to "point to"
   existing semantic descriptors with the current ALPS doc (or some
   other doc (e.g. schem.org) would be helpful. no? -mca]

2.2.12.  'type'

   Indicates the type of representation control to which the element is
   applied.  This MUST appear for each element.  Four valid values are
   defined:

   "descriptor"  A state element (e.g.  HTML.SPAN, HTML.INPUT, etc.)  OR
      a hypermedia control that triggers a safe, idempotent transition
      (e.g.  HTTP.GET or HTTP.HEAD).

   "safe"  A hypermedia control that triggers a safe, idempotent state
      transition (e.g.  HTTP.GET or HTTP.HEAD).

   "idempotent"  A hypermedia control that triggers an unsafe,
      idempotent state transition (e.g.  HTTP.PUT or HTTP.DELETE).

   "unsafe"  A hypermedia control that triggers an unsafe, non-
      idempotent state transition (e.g.  HTTP.POST).

   If no 'type' attribute is associated with the element then
   'type="descriptor"' is implied.

2.2.13.  'value'

   Contains a human-readable string.  It MAY appear as an attribute of
   the 'doc' (Section 2.2.2) and the 'ext' (Section 2.2.4) elements.

2.2.14.  'version'

   Indicates the version of the ALPS specification used in the document.
   This SHOULD appear as a property of the 'alps' (Section 2.2.1)

   element.  Currently the only valid value is "1.0".  If no value
   appears, then 'version="1.0"' is implied.

   appear in each format, along with examples to guide ALPS document
   authors.

   and transition descriptors.  This document was genrated from the XML
   and JSON ALPS documents that follow.  Use this HTML document as a

2.3.3.1.  JSON Representation Notes

   When representing ALPS documents in JSON format, the 'descriptor'
   (Section 2.2.3) and 'ext' (Section 2.2.4) properties are always
   expressed as arrays of anonymous objects - even when there is only
   one member in the array.

       }
   ]

                            Arrays in ALPS+JSON

   The 'doc' (Section 2.2.2) property is always expressed as a named
   object.

   For example:

   {
       "doc" : {
           "format" : "text",
           "value" : "Rules are imporant"

3.  Applying ALPS documents to Existing Media Types

   An ALPS document can be applied to many existing hypermedia types.
   Section 1.3 gave some informative examples of this.  Normative, up-
   to-date guidance on applying ALPS documents to existing media types
   are available at the official ALPS Web site (http://alps.io).  [I

   Defining how an ALPS document is to be applied to a media type
   requires defining the following:

      How to mark up a state element in the representation with the name
      of a ALPS element that sets type="descriptor".  Informative
      examples:

         In an HTML representation, any HTML tag that supports the
         "class" attribute may use the name or URI of any such ALPS
         element as one value for the "class" attribute.

         In an HTML 5 representation that uses microdata, any HTML tag
         may use the name or URI of any such ALPS element as one value
         for the "itemprop" attribute.

         In a bare XML representation, the name of any such ALPS element
         may be used as a tag name.

      How to mark up a hypermedia control in the representation with the
      name of an ALPS element that sets type="descriptor" or
      type="safe".  Informative examples:

         In an HTML representation, any HTML tag that supports the "rel"
         attribute" ("a", "link", etc.) may use the name or URI of any
         such ALPS element as the value for the "rel" attribute.

         In an HTML representation, any "form" tag that sets
         method="GET" may use the name or URI of any such ALPS element
         as one value for the "class" attribute of any of its "submit"
         tags.

         In a HAL representation, any "link" tag may use use the name or
         URI of any such ALPS element as one value for its "rel"
         attribute.

      How to mark up a hypermedia control with the name of an ALPS
      element that sets type="idempotent".  Informative example:

         In an HTML representation, a "form" tag that sets method="POST"
         may use the name or URI of any such ALPS element as one value
         for the "class" attribute of any of its "submit" tags.

      How to mark up a hypermedia control with the name of an ALPS
      element that sets type="unsafe".  Informative example:

         In an HTML representation, a "form" tag that sets method="POST"
         may use the name or URI of any such ALPS element as one value
         for the "class" attribute of any of its "submit" tags.

      How to represent the relationship between an enclosing ALPS
      descriptor and the descriptor it encloses.  Informative examples:

         In an HTML or XML representation, a tag marked up as an ALPS
         descriptor may contain a child tag marked up as one of the
         children of that ALPS descriptor.

   Not all media types can faithfully represent all ALPS descriptors.
   For instance, the 'application/json' media type has no standard way
   of representing hyperlinks.  The details of how to apply ALPS to such
   a media type will necesarily be incomplete, and it will not be
   possible to represent some aspects of an ALPS profile in documents in
   that media type.

   [TK could we say that such a media type is not in complete compliance
   with the ALPS document? -leonardr] :: [we might want to add a
   compliance section in this spec.  IOW, what parts of ALPS a media
   type MUST/SHOULD/MAY support in order to be "fully compliant" (all
   MUSTs and SHOULDs, "conditionally compliant" (all MUSTs), and "non-
   compliant" (not all MUSTs) -mca]

3.1.  Linking to ALPS Documents

   To indicate that an ALPS profile describes the semantics of some
   representation document, the representation document SHOULD link to
   the ALPS document using the "profile" link relation (found in the
   IANA registry of link relations).  If the media type of the
   representation document has no native ability to link to other
   resources, or no ability to express link relations, the HTTP header
   'Link' [RFC5988] MAY be used to connect the representation document
   to the ALPS profile.  If the media type of the representation
   document defines a parameter for linking the document to a profile,
   that parameter MAY be used to connect the representation document and
   the ALPS profile.  If the media type of the representation document
   defines a hypermedia control especially for linking to profiles, it
   MAY be used and no link relation is necessary.

   A single representation document may be described by more than one
   ALPS profile.  If two ALPS profiles give conflicting semantics for
   the same element, the document linked to earlier in the
   representation SHOULD take precedence.  A profile linked to using the
   'Link' header takes precedence over a profile linked to within the
   representation document itself.  A profile linked to using a media
   type parameter takes precedence over a profile linked to using the
   'Link' header and a profile linked to within the representation
   document itself.  [TK I added that, it seems right.  But this is very
   complicated. -leonardr]

5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification establishes two media types: 'application/
   alps+xml' and 'application/alps+json'

5.1.  application/alps+xml

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  alps+xml

   Required parameters:  None

   Optional parameters:

      charset  This parameter has identical semantics to the charset
         parameter of the 'application/xml' media type as specified in
         [RFC3023].

      profile  A whitespace-separated list of IRIs identifying specific
         constraints or conventions that apply to an ALPS document.  A
         profile must not change the semantics of the resource
         representation when processed without profile knowledge, so
         that clients both with and without knowledge of a profiled
         resource can safely use the same representation.  The profile
         parameter may also be used by clients to express their
         preferences in the content negotiation process.  It is
         recommended that profile IRIs are dereferenceable and provide
         useful documentation at that IRI.

   Encoding considerations:

      binary  Same as encoding considerations of application/xml as
         specified in [RFC3023].

   Security considerations:  This format shares security issues common
      to all XML content types.  It does not provide executable content.
      Information contained in ALPS documents do not require privacy or
      integrity services.

   Interoperability considerations:  ALPS is not described by a DTD and
      applies only the well-formedness rules of XML.  It should only be
      parsed by a non-validating parser.
